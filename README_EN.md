<h2>An engine for searching secondments of educators</h2>

<p>http://apospaseis.ellak.gr/</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

Every year, many teachers and educators of greek public sector move from region to region and to the institutions of ministry of education through the procedure of secondments. The secondment decisions  issued during the first semester of each school year, from different departments of the ministry, in several electronic files that do not follow specific standards (THey are completely different). Consequently, important information regarding the secondments lost in the multiple files.

This project aims to develop @pospaseis: It is a service that allows the users to discover this hidden information through a multi-criteria search engine. The engine allows the easy navigation to the numerous secondment decisions. Therefore, the user of the service can easily "discover", for example, how many educators, the corresponding names as well as their specialities were secondmented to a particular institute. 

In addition, @pospaseis offers an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows the search and the retrieval of information in JSON form through http requests. Thus, @pospaseis enables developers to perform searches from their application or web-site.

<h2>API</h2>

@pospaseis offers an Application Programming Interface (API) 
that allows the users to easily retrieve the results of a search in JSON form. Therefore, @pospaseis enables programmers to use the @pospaseis's data in their application. Here: 
 <a href="https://github.com/ellak-monades-aristeias/apospaseis/wiki/API">wiki/API</a> you can find instructions on how you can use the API.

<h2>Instructions for the users</h2>
